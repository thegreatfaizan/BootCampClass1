    <body>
        <h1>Headings</h1>
        <p>HTML defines six levels of headings. A heading element implies all the font changes, paragraph breaks before and after, and any white space necessary to render the heading. The heading elements are H1, H2, H3, H4, H5, and H6 with H1 being the highest (or most important) level and H6 the least</p>
        <h1>This is level 1 heading</h1>
        <h2>This is level 2 heading</h2>
        <h3>This is level 3 heading</h3>
        <h4>This is level 4 heading</h4>
        <h5>This is level 5 heading</h5>
        <h6>This is level 6 heading</h6>
        <h1>Paragraphs</h1>
        <p>Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</p>
        <p>A paragraph always starts on a new line, and browsers automatically add some white space (a margin) before and after a paragraph.</p>
        <h1>Bold</h1>
        <p><b>This text is written in BOLD</b></p>
        <h1>Italic</h1>
        <p><i>This text is written in italic</i></p>
        <h1>Underline</h1>
        <p><u>This text is written in Underline</u></p>
        <h1>Subscript</h1>
        <p>Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font. Subscript text can be used for chemical formulas, like H<sub>2</sub>O.</p>
        <h1>Superscript</h1>
        <p>So, all of us has seen power to variables or numbers at many places and several times. That is exactly know as superscript, the value which is a bit elevated from the main text, like x<sup>2</sup>, 1<sup>st</sup>.</p>
        <h1>White Space</h1>
        <p>Alternatively referred to as spacing or whitespace, 
        white space is any section of a document that is unused or    space around an object. 
        White spaces help separate paragraphs of text, graphics,      and other portions of a document, 
        and helps a document look less crowded. 
        Using white space effectively in a document keeps the    reader reading the document, 
        and helps the reader     quickly find what they are  interested in reading.
        In this paragraph we used some extra spaces which are not shown by our browser.
        </p>
        <h1>Line Breaks</h1>
        <p>The line break tag inserts a single line break.<br />The line break tag is useful for writing addresses or poems.<br />The line break tag is an empty tag which means that it has no end tag.<br /><b>For Example:</b><br />When it rains, water comes.<br/>But when it more rains,<br />More water comes.</p>
        <h1>Horizontal Rule</h1>
        <p>The Horizontal Rule tag defines a thematic break in an HTML page (e.g. a shift of topic). The element is most often displayed as a horizontal rule that is used to separate content (or define a change) in an HTML page.</p>
        <p><b>For Example:</b></p>
        <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. HTML describes the structure of a Web page, and consists of a series of elements. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>CSS is a language that describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work, because it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web. JavaScript can change HTML content and attribute values. JavaScript can change CSS. JavaScript can hide and show HTML elements, and more.</p>
        <h1>Strong</h1>
        <p>The HTML Strong Importance Element indicates that its contents have <strong>strong</strong> importance, seriousness, or urgency. Browsers typically render the contents in bold type</p>
        <h1>Emphasis</h1>
        <p>The Emphasis tag is used to define emphasized text. The content inside is typically displayed in italic. A screen reader will pronounce the words with <em>an emphasis</em>, using verbal stress.</p>
        <h1>Quotations</h1>
        <p>The HTML Quotations element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. ... This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the blockquote element</p>
        <h3>Blockqoute</h3>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.parc.gov.pk/index.php/en/quotes-of-quaid-e-azam">
            <p>I do not believe in taking the right decision, I take a decision and make it right.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <h3>Quotes</h3>
        <p>Once M.A Jinnah said, <q>Democracy is in the blood of the Muslims, who look upon complete equality of mankind, and believe in fraternity, equality, and liberty.</q></p>
        <h1>Abbreviation or Acronym</h1>
        <p>The HTML Abbreviation element represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>I am learning <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> from <abbr title="Presidential Intiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing">PIAIC</abbr>.</p>
        <h1>Author Details(Address)</h1>
        <p>The HTML Abbreviation element represents an abbreviation or acronym; the optional title attribute can provide an expansion or description for the abbreviation. If present, title must contain this full description and nothing else.</p>

        </address>
        <h1>Citations and Definitions</h1>
        <h3>Citations</h3>
        <p>The HTML Citation element is used to describe a reference to a cited creative work, and must include the title of that work. The reference may be in an abbreviated form according to context-appropriate conventions related to citation metadata.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <blockquote>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>The definition tag specifies a term that is going to be defined within the content. The nearest parent of the definition tag must also contain the definition/explanation for the term.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p><dfn>HTML</dfn> is the standard markup language for creating web pages.</p>
        <h1>Changes to content</h1>
        <h3>Delete and Insert</h3>
        <p>The HTML ins element represents a range of text that has been added to a document. You can use the del element to similarly represent a range of text that has been deleted from the document.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>

        <h3>Strikethrough</h3>

        <p><s>$1100</s></p>
        <p>$1000</p>
        <h1>Orderd List and Unordered List</h1>
        <h3>Ordered List</h3>
        <p>The ol tag defines an ordered list. An ordered list can be numerical or alphabetical. The li tag is used to define each list item.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>Pakistan's Top 5 universities are:</p>
        <ol><li>National University of Sciences and Technology(Islamabad)</li><li>University of Punjab(Lahore)</li><li>Lahore University of Management Sciences</li><li>Quaid-e-Azam University(Islamabad)</li><li>University of Engineering Technology(Lahore)</li></ol>
        <h3>Unorderd List</h3>
        <p>The HTML ul element represents an unordered list of items, typically rendered as a bulleted list.</p>
        <p><b>Example:</b></p>
        <p>Da Royal Pizza's Menu:</p>
        <ul><li>Chicker Fajita</li><li>Chicken Tikka</li><li>European Delight</li><li>Afghani Chicken</li></ul>
        <h1>Definition List</h1>
        <P>The HTML dl element represents a description list. ... Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</P>
